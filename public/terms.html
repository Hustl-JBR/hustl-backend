    <h1>Hustl – Terms of Use</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Legal Agreement for Using the Hustl Platform</div>
  </div>

  <a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Hustl</a>

  <div class="content">
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2, 2024</p>
    

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Hustl is currently designed for use only within the State of Tennessee. By using Hustl, you confirm that (a) you are at least 18, and (b) any jobs you post or perform through Hustl take place entirely in Tennessee.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are and What These Terms Do</h2>

    <p>These Hustl Terms of Use ("Terms") are a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "user," "Customer," or "Hustler") and Hustl (referred to as "Hustl," "we," "our," or "us").</p>

    <p>Hustl is a marketplace platform that lets individuals and small businesses ("Hustlers") offer services to other users ("Customers") who need help with tasks such as hauling, moving, yard work, and similar jobs. Hustl itself does not perform these services and does not employ Hustlers.</p>

    <p>By creating an account, accessing, or using Hustl in any way, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Tennessee-Only Service Area</h2>

    <p>Hustl is built to operate exclusively in Tennessee:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hustl is targeted only to Tennessee residents or people physically present in Tennessee.</li>
      <li>Jobs posted or performed through Hustl must be located entirely within Tennessee.</li>
      <li>We do not intend Hustl to be used in or directed to any other state or country.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you access Hustl from outside Tennessee, you do so at your own risk and you are responsible for complying with local laws. Hustl may block or terminate accounts that appear to be using the platform outside Tennessee.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>

    <p>To use Hustl you must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 18 years old.</li>
      <li>Have the legal capacity to enter a contract under Tennessee law.</li>
      <li>Agree to these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may not use Hustl if you are barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or Tennessee, or if your account has previously been suspended or terminated by Hustl.</p>

    <h2>4. Hustl's Role – Marketplace Platform Only</h2>

    <p>Hustl is a neutral, third-party marketplace platform. We do not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide or supervise the services offered by Hustlers;</li>
      <li>Control how, when, or where Hustlers perform services;</li>
      <li>Guarantee any outcome of any job;</li>
      <li>Provide insurance, bonding, or a warranty for any service or Hustler;</li>
      <li>Act as a general contractor, employer, joint venturer, or partner of any Hustler.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Contracts for services are directly between Customers and Hustlers, even if they are created or recorded through the Hustl platform.</p>

    <p>Hustl may facilitate communication, provide tools to schedule jobs, and process payments through Stripe, but we are not a party to service contracts between users and have no control over the acts or omissions of any user.</p>

    <h2>5. Hustlers as Independent "Marketplace Contractors"</h2>

    <p>To the maximum extent allowed by Tennessee law, Hustlers using Hustl are intended to be treated as independent contractors, not employees of Hustl. Tennessee's "marketplace contractor" statute supports independent contractor status where certain conditions are met, including a written agreement confirming independent contractor status and limits on the platform's control over the worker.</p>

    <p>By signing up as a Hustler, you agree that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You are an independent contractor and not an employee of Hustl for any purpose.</li>
      <li>You control when, where, and how you do jobs you accept, including your schedule and tools, subject only to what you agree with a Customer.</li>
      <li>You can accept or decline any job request.</li>
      <li>You are free to use other platforms and do other work at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your own income, business, and employment taxes;</li>
      <li>Any required licenses, permits, or registrations;</li>
      <li>Insurance (e.g., general liability, auto, workers' comp, etc., if applicable);</li>
      <li>Any assistants or helpers you choose to bring for a job.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you bring an assistant or subcontractor, you are solely responsible for paying them and making sure they follow these Terms and all applicable laws.</p>

    <p>Nothing in these Terms guarantees that Hustl qualifies for any specific safe harbor or classification under Tennessee law; you are responsible for seeking your own legal or tax advice.</p>

    <h2>6. User Accounts</h2>

    <p>You must create an account to use Hustl:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
      <li>You must promptly update your info (name, contact info, payment details) if it changes.</li>
      <li>We may, but are not required to, request ID verification or additional documents at any time and may suspend your account if we cannot verify necessary information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Types of Users: Customers and Hustlers</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customers:</strong> Post jobs, review offers, communicate with Hustlers, and pay through Hustl.</li>
      <li><strong>Hustlers:</strong> Review available jobs, make offers, perform accepted jobs, and receive payouts through Hustl.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A single user can be both a Customer and a Hustler, but each role comes with its own responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>8. Jobs, Job Descriptions, and Prohibited Activities</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Job Descriptions</h3>

    <p><strong>Customers must:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide clear, honest descriptions of the job;</li>
      <li>Disclose relevant risks (stairs, heavy items, special tools required, pets, etc.);</li>
      <li>Only post jobs they actually intend to pay for through Hustl.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Hustlers must:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carefully read job descriptions and ask questions before accepting;</li>
      <li>Only accept jobs they are capable and legally allowed to perform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 Prohibited Jobs and Uses</h3>

    <p>You may not use Hustl for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Any illegal activity or job;</li>
      <li>Jobs that require a license (e.g., certain electrical, plumbing, medical, or professional services) unless the Hustler holds all necessary licenses and permits;</li>
      <li>Jobs involving weapons, illegal substances, or dangerous materials;</li>
      <li>Adult or sexually explicit services;</li>
      <li>Fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading activity;</li>
      <li>Harassment, stalking, threats, or discrimination;</li>
      <li>Any use that violates these Terms or applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hustl may remove job posts or suspend accounts at its sole discretion if we believe they involve prohibited or unsafe activity. However, Hustl does not guarantee that all prohibited jobs will be found or removed. You are responsible for making sure the job you offer or accept is lawful and safe.</p>

    <h2>9. Fees, Payments, and Stripe</h2>

    <h3>9.1 Payment Processing</h3>

    <p>All payments on Hustl are processed through Stripe or a similar third-party payment provider. Your use of payments on Hustl is also subject to Stripe's own terms of service, privacy policy, and requirements, which may change over time.</p>

    <p>Hustl does not store your full credit or debit card numbers. Those are stored and processed by Stripe or another payment processor on our behalf.</p>

    <h3>9.2 Platform Fee (16%)</h3>

    <p>For each job paid through Hustl:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Customer pays the total job amount through Hustl.</li>
      <li>Hustl charges a platform fee of <strong>16% of the gross job amount</strong> (plus any applicable Stripe processing or payout fees).</li>
      <li>The Hustler receives the remaining amount (for example, roughly 84% of the job price, minus any Stripe/payment processor fees, chargebacks, or adjustments).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may update the platform fee in the future. If we do, we will provide notice on the app or site, and the new fee will apply only to jobs accepted after the update.</p>

    <h3>9.3 Authorization and Holds</h3>

    <p>By hiring a Hustler, the Customer authorizes Hustl (through Stripe) to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Charge the full job amount plus any applicable fees and taxes;</li>
      <li>Place a temporary hold on funds;</li>
      <li>Capture the payment once the job is marked complete, auto-completed, or resolved following a dispute process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Job Completion, Disputes, and Auto-Release of Funds</h2>

    <h3>10.1 Completion Flow</h3>

    <p>When a Hustler marks a job as completed in the Hustl platform:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Customer is notified and can:
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm completion;</li>
          <li>Report a problem; or</li>
          <li>Request a reasonable revision (if both sides agree).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the Customer takes no action within a reasonable time (for example, 48–72 hours), Hustl may, but is not required to, treat the job as completed and instruct Stripe to release payment to the Hustler, minus Hustl's fees.</li>
      <li>Hustl may adjust the response window or apply different time windows for different job categories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10.2 Disputes Between Customers and Hustlers</h3>

    <p>If a Customer reports a problem within the allowed time, Hustl may request information from both sides (messages, photos, job details, receipts, etc.). In its sole discretion, Hustl may:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Release all or part of the payment to the Hustler;</li>
      <li>Refund all or part of the payment to the Customer;</li>
      <li>Hold funds while the parties resolve the issue; or</li>
      <li>Decline to intervene and let the parties resolve it independently.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any decision Hustl makes about funds held in the platform is final as between you and Hustl. These decisions do not prevent either user from pursuing legal remedies directly against the other, as allowed by law.</p>

    <h2>11. Payments Outside the Hustl Platform</h2>

    <p>All jobs found or arranged through Hustl must be paid through Hustl, unless we give specific written permission otherwise.</p>

    <p>You agree not to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Request, suggest, or accept off-platform payment to avoid Hustl's fees;</li>
      <li>Pay or get paid in cash, personal apps, or other methods for a Hustl job.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you choose to bypass Hustl and pay off-platform anyway, you do so entirely at your own risk. Hustl has no responsibility for disputes, losses, injuries, chargebacks, or damages arising from off-platform payments. We may suspend or terminate accounts that attempt to avoid Hustl's payment system.</p>

    <h2>12. Taxes</h2>

    <p>Hustlers and Customers are solely responsible for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Determining if any sales, use, or other taxes apply to a job;</li>
      <li>Reporting and paying all applicable taxes (including income and self-employment taxes).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hustl does not provide tax advice and may, but is not required to, issue tax forms (such as 1099s) through Stripe or another provider.</p>

    <h2>13. Reviews, Ratings, and User Content</h2>

    <p>Customers and Hustlers may leave ratings and written reviews. By posting reviews or other content (photos, text, profile info), you grant Hustl a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and distribute that content for operating and promoting the platform.</p>

    <p>You agree that your content will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be accurate and based on your genuine experience;</li>
      <li>Not be defamatory, hateful, harassing, or otherwise unlawful;</li>
      <li>Not violate any third-party rights (privacy, confidentiality, IP, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hustl may remove or edit content at its discretion but is not obligated to police every review.</p>

    <h2>14. Safety; No Background Checks or Insurance</h2>

    <p>Hustl does not guarantee the identity, background, criminal history, driving record, insurance status, or qualifications of any user. We may offer optional checks or verification steps, but you should not rely solely on them.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for your own safety:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Meet in safe, public or visible locations where possible;</li>
      <li>Use common sense and your judgment before allowing someone into your home or vehicle;</li>
      <li>Ask questions about tools, vehicles, and experience;</li>
      <li>Consider seeking your own legal advice and maintaining your own insurance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hustl does not provide or arrange liability insurance, workers' compensation, property coverage, or any other insurance for jobs.</p>

    <h2>15. Acceptable Use</h2>

    <p>You agree not to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use Hustl in any way that could damage, disable, or impair our systems;</li>
      <li>Access or attempt to access accounts that are not yours;</li>
      <li>Interfere with other users' use of the platform;</li>
      <li>Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) without written permission;</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to obtain the source code of Hustl;</li>
      <li>Use Hustl to send spam, phishing, or fraudulent messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may monitor use of Hustl to protect our systems and users and may suspend or terminate accounts that violate this section.</p>

    <h2>16. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>Hustl integrates with third-party services to operate the platform, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> Stripe and similar payment processors handle all payment transactions. Your use of payments is subject to Stripe's terms of service and privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Database and Cloud Hosting:</strong> Secure cloud database and hosting providers store platform data and user information.</li>
      <li><strong>File Storage:</strong> Cloud storage services securely store photos and documents uploaded by users.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and Security Tools:</strong> Services that help us understand platform usage and protect against fraud and security threats.</li>
      <li><strong>Mapping/Location Services:</strong> Services that help with location-based features and job matching.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Those services have their own terms and privacy policies. Hustl is not responsible for the actions, omissions, or policies of third-party providers, even if we use or recommend them. However, we select providers that meet industry standards for security and data protection.</p>

    <h2>17. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <p>All rights in the Hustl platform (code, design, logo, trademarks, content we create) are owned by Hustl or its licensors. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use Hustl for personal or internal business purposes, in compliance with these Terms.</p>

    <p>You may not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, or create derivative works based on Hustl;</li>
      <li>Use our trademarks or branding without written permission;</li>
      <li>Resell or commercially exploit Hustl (other than performing services as a Hustler).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>18. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

    <p><strong>HUSTL IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong></p>

    <p>Without limiting the generality of the above, we do not warrant that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The platform will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free;</li>
      <li>Any job, user, or service will meet your expectations;</li>
      <li>Content or information on Hustl is complete, accurate, or current.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You use Hustl and interact with other users at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>19. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p>To the maximum extent allowed by Tennessee law:</p>

    <p><strong>HUSTL AND ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF INCOME, PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>HUSTL IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF CUSTOMERS, HUSTLERS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR OTHER HARM CAUSED DURING OR RELATED TO JOBS ARRANGED THROUGH THE PLATFORM.</strong></p>

    <p>In any case, Hustl's total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the platform will not exceed the greater of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The total platform fees you paid to Hustl in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim; or</li>
      <li>$100 (one hundred U.S. dollars).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some limitations may not apply if prohibited by law, but because Hustl is Tennessee-only, these limitations are intended to be enforceable under Tennessee law.</p>

    <h2>20. Indemnification</h2>

    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Hustl and its owners, officers, employees, contractors, and affiliates from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your use of Hustl;</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
      <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights;</li>
      <li>Any job you post, perform, or participate in.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>21. Changes to the Platform and Terms</h2>

    <p>We may update or change Hustl, including features, and we may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms with a new "Last updated" date and may provide additional notice (e.g., in-app or email).</p>

    <p>If you continue to use Hustl after the updated Terms go into effect, you are agreeing to them. If you do not agree, you must stop using Hustl and close your account.</p>

    <h2>22. Dispute Resolution with Hustl; Arbitration; No Class Actions</h2>

    <p>If you have a dispute directly with Hustl (not just another user), you agree to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>First email us at <a href="mailto:team.hustlapp@outlook.com">team.hustlapp@outlook.com</a> with a brief written description so we can try to resolve it informally.</li>
      <li>Allow 30 days for informal resolution efforts.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, then, except for claims that may be brought in small-claims court, you and Hustl agree to binding, individual arbitration:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The arbitration will be administered by a recognized provider (e.g., American Arbitration Association) under its applicable rules.</li>
      <li>The arbitration will take place in or around Knox County, Tennessee, unless we both agree to another location or a remote process.</li>
      <li>The arbitrator may award any relief a court could award, except that the arbitrator may not award class-wide or representative relief.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You and Hustl agree that each may bring claims only in your individual capacity, not as a class member or representative in any class or representative action.</p>

    <p>If any part of this class-action waiver is found unenforceable for a particular claim, that claim (and only that claim) must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Knox County, Tennessee, and not in arbitration.</p>

    <h2>23. Governing Law and Venue</h2>

    <p>These Terms and any disputes between you and Hustl are governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.</p>
