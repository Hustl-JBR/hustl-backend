  <h1>Hustl – Terms of Use &amp; Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtle">
    We want Hustl to feel simple and safe to use. These Terms of Use and Privacy Policy explain how Hustl works,
    what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you when you use the platform.
  </p>

  <!-- TERMS OF USE -->

  <div class="section-label">Legal</div>
  <h2 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h2>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Platform Purpose:</strong> Hustl is a platform to connect individuals (“Hustlers”) offering services with those (“Customers”) who need them. Hustl is not a party to agreements between users and assumes no liability for job performance, damages, or payment outside what is explicitly managed on the platform.</p>

  <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Users must be 18 years or older. By using Hustl, you represent that you are legally able to form a binding contract under the laws of the state of Tennessee.</p>

  <p><strong>Payments &amp; Fees:</strong> Hustl takes a 15% fee from the total amount paid by the Customer. Payments must be marked complete in the Hustl platform before a Hustler is eligible to be paid. All payments are processed through Stripe. Hustl does not store or access credit card information.</p>

  <p>
    When a Customer hires a Hustler, the Customer authorizes Hustl (via Stripe) to charge the full job amount.
    Hustl may hold funds in a Stripe-managed account until (a) the Customer marks the job complete, (b) the parties
    reach a resolution, or (c) Hustl makes a good-faith determination after a review of a dispute. If a Customer does
    not mark a job complete or report a problem within a reasonable time after the Hustler reports completion, Hustl
    may, but is not required to, treat the job as completed and release payment to the Hustler.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Hustler Responsibility:</strong> Hustlers are independent contractors, not employees of Hustl. They are solely responsible for taxes, legal compliance, and service quality. Hustl is not liable for the behavior or performance of any Hustler.</p>

  <p><strong>Customer Responsibility:</strong> Customers must accurately describe jobs and pay the agreed amount once a job is accepted and marked complete.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Prohibited Jobs:</strong>
    Hustl may remove job postings that involve unsafe, illegal, unlicensed, or adult services at its sole discretion.
    However, Hustl does not guarantee that all such jobs will be removed or detected. It is your responsibility to make
    sure you are legally allowed to offer or purchase any service and that you meet any licensing, permit, or insurance
    requirements that apply.
  </p>

  <h3>Job Completion, Disputes, and Auto-Release of Funds</h3>

  <p>
    When a Hustler indicates through the Hustl platform that a job has been completed, the Customer will be notified
    and asked to either (a) confirm completion, (b) report an issue, or (c) request a reasonable revision if agreed
    between the parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Customer does not respond or take action within a reasonable period (for example, 48–72 hours),
    Hustl may, but is not required to, treat the job as completed and instruct Stripe to release the applicable
    payment to the Hustler, minus any platform fees. Hustl may adjust this response window over time and may set
    different windows for different categories of jobs.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Customer reports an issue or dispute within the allowed time, Hustl may request additional information
    from both parties (including messages, photos, or other proof) and may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>release all or part of the payment to the Hustler,</li>
    <li>refund all or part of the payment to the Customer, or</li>
    <li>take no action and allow the parties to resolve the matter directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You understand and agree that Hustl’s decision regarding the handling of funds within the platform is final as
    between you and Hustl. This does not prevent you from pursuing any separate claim directly against another user,
    to the extent allowed by applicable law.
  </p>

  <h3>Payments Outside the Platform</h3>

  <p>
    All jobs found or arranged through Hustl must be paid through the Hustl platform unless Hustl gives written
    permission otherwise. You agree not to encourage or accept payment for a Hustl job in cash, by personal
    payment apps, or by any other method intended to avoid Hustl’s fees or payment systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you choose to make or accept payment outside of Hustl despite this rule, you do so entirely at your own risk.
    Hustl will have no responsibility or liability for any disputes, losses, chargebacks, injuries, or damages arising
    from off-platform payments. Hustl may suspend or terminate accounts that attempt to bypass Hustl’s payment system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hustlers are solely responsible for making sure they have any licenses, permits, insurance, or other authorizations
    required for the services they offer. Hustl does not guarantee that jobs or Hustlers meet any licensing or professional
    requirements and has no duty to monitor or screen jobs for compliance.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Account Suspension:</strong> Hustl reserves the right to suspend or delete any account that violates these terms, involves fraud, harassment, or unsafe activity, or otherwise risks harm to users or the platform.</p>

  <h3>Disputes Between Customers and Hustlers</h3>

  <p>
    Hustl is not a party to contracts between Customers and Hustlers. If there is a disagreement about whether a job was done,
    done correctly, or should be paid, the Customer and Hustler should first attempt to resolve the issue directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you cannot resolve the issue directly, you agree to contact Hustl at
    <a href="mailto:team.hustlapp@outlook.com">team.hustlapp@outlook.com</a>
    within a reasonable time and provide any information we request (such as messages, photos, or job details).
    Hustl may, but is not obligated to, review the situation and decide whether to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>release payment to the Hustler,</li>
    <li>refund all or part of the payment to the Customer, or</li>
    <li>take no action and leave the funds as-is until the parties resolve the matter themselves.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any decision Hustl makes about a dispute involving payments on the platform is final with respect to Hustl and the flow of
    funds through Hustl and Stripe. This does not stop either party from pursuing other remedies directly against each other
    outside the platform, subject to applicable law.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties:</strong> Hustl is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee the availability, reliability, or outcome of services found on the platform.</p>

  <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Hustl is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of income or data, resulting from your use of the platform.</p>

  <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold Hustl and its affiliates harmless from any claims, liabilities, or legal fees arising from your use of the platform or violation of these terms.</p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Hustl integrates with third-party providers like Stripe. We are not responsible for their policies, actions, or service interruptions.</p>

  <h3>Dispute Resolution with Hustl; Arbitration</h3>

  <p>
    If you have a dispute or claim against Hustl itself (not just another user), you agree to first email us at
    <a href="mailto:team.hustlapp@outlook.com">team.hustlapp@outlook.com</a>
    with a brief description of the issue so we can try to resolve it informally. Both you and Hustl agree to make a good-faith
    effort to resolve the dispute within 30 days.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, except for claims that may be brought in small-claims court, you and Hustl
    agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of the platform or these Terms
    will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration instead of in court.
  </p>

  <p>
    The arbitration will be administered by a recognized arbitration provider (such as the American Arbitration Association)
    under its applicable rules. The arbitration will take place in or around Knox County, Tennessee, unless we both agree
    to a different location or to a remote / documents-only process. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court
    could award, except that the arbitrator may not award class-wide or representative relief.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You and Hustl agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your individual
    capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a court or arbitrator decides that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable for a particular claim,
    then that claim must be brought only in a court of competent jurisdiction in Knox County, Tennessee, and not in arbitration.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Governing Law and Venue:</strong> These terms are governed by the laws of the state of Tennessee, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any court proceedings (to the extent allowed under this section) shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Knox County, TN, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.</p>
