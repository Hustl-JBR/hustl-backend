    <h1>Hustl – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">How We Collect, Use, and Protect Your Information</div>
  </div>

  <a href="index.html" class="back-link">← Back to Hustl</a>

  <div class="content">
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 20, 2025</p>
    

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Hustl collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information when you use the Hustl platform within Tennessee.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Tennessee's Information Protection Act (TIPA) took effect July 1, 2025, and gives certain privacy rights to Tennessee consumers when a business meets specific size thresholds. Hustl is currently a small platform and may not yet be within TIPA's mandatory scope, but we aim to follow many of its principles and will update this Policy as Hustl grows.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We collect information in three main ways: (1) you provide it directly, (2) we collect it automatically, and (3) we receive it from third parties.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>

    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email address, password</li>
      <li>Phone number (if you choose to add it)</li>
      <li>Profile details (photo, bio, general service area, skills)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Job & Transaction Information</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jobs you post, accept, or complete</li>
      <li>Job descriptions, dates, locations, and agreed prices</li>
      <li>Messages between Customers and Hustlers sent through Hustl</li>
      <li>Reviews and ratings you leave or receive</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Payment and Payout Information</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment method details (processed by Stripe)</li>
      <li>Bank or payout details for Hustlers (handled by Stripe where possible)</li>
      <li>Transaction amounts, fees, refunds, and chargebacks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not store your full credit or debit card numbers on Hustl servers; Stripe or another payment processor handles those details.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3>

    <p>When you use Hustl, we may automatically collect:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Device type, operating system, and browser type</li>
      <li>IP address and general approximate location (e.g., city/region)</li>
      <li>Log data (pages viewed, actions taken, timestamps)</li>
      <li>Basic analytics data to understand how users interact with Hustl</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use this data mainly to secure the platform, prevent fraud, and improve performance.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>

    <p>We may receive information from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Payment processors (e.g., status of payments, chargebacks)</li>
      <li>Cloud hosting and security providers (e.g., IP risk scores)</li>
      <li>Verification or anti-fraud providers, if we use them in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use this information only to support our core purposes (matching users, processing payments, preventing abuse).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use personal information for:</p>

    <p><strong>Operating the Hustl Platform</strong></p>

    </ul>

      <li>Protecting the rights, property, or safety of Hustl, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not sell your personal information in the sense of selling lists of users to data brokers, and we do not use your personal information for targeted advertising at this time.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>

    <p>We may use:</p>

    <p><strong>Cookies and browser storage to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep you logged in;</li>
      <li>Remember basic preferences;</li>
      <li>Help secure your session.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Basic analytics tools to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Count visits;</li>
      <li>Understand feature usage;</li>
      <li>Improve performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not use cookies to track you across unrelated websites for advertising.</p>

    <p>You can usually control cookies through your browser settings; however, disabling essential cookies may impact your ability to use Hustl.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>We share personal information only in limited circumstances:</p>

    <p><strong>With Other Users</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you post a job, certain info (first name, city/area, job details) may be visible to potential Hustlers.</li>
      <li>When you are a Hustler, Customers may see your profile, reviews, and information you choose to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>With Service Providers (Processors)</strong></p>
    <p>We may share information with trusted vendors who help us run Hustl, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> Stripe and similar payment processors handle payment transactions. Your use of payments is also subject to Stripe's terms and privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Database and Cloud Hosting Providers:</strong> Secure cloud database and hosting services store your account data, job information, and platform data.</li>
      <li><strong>File Storage Providers:</strong> Cloud storage services securely store photos and documents you upload.</li>
      <li><strong>Email and Notification Services:</strong> Services that send transactional emails and notifications about your account and jobs.</li>
      <li><strong>Security and Anti-Fraud Tools:</strong> Services that help us detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These providers are contractually required to use your data only as needed to provide their services to us and must protect it with appropriate security measures. They are not permitted to use your personal information for their own purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>For Legal or Safety Reasons</strong></p>
    <p>We may share information if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with a law, regulation, or legal request;</li>
      <li>Protect the safety, rights, or property of Hustl, users, or the public;</li>
      <li>Investigate suspected fraud, security issues, or violations of our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Business Changes</strong></p>
    <p>If Hustl is ever involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or similar transaction, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this Policy and applicable law.</p>

    <p>We do not sell personal information to data brokers, and we do not share personal information with third parties for their own independent marketing.</p>

    <h2>5. Where We Store Your Information</h2>

    <p>Hustl uses secure, industry-standard cloud-based service providers located in the United States to store and process your information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Database Services:</strong> Your account information, job data, messages, and transaction records are stored in secure, encrypted databases hosted by reputable cloud database providers in the United States.</li>
      <li><strong>File Storage:</strong> Photos and documents you upload (such as job photos or profile pictures) are stored using secure cloud storage services with encryption and access controls.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payment information is processed and stored by Stripe, a PCI-DSS compliant payment processor. Hustl does not store your full credit or debit card numbers.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> The Hustl platform itself is hosted on secure cloud infrastructure in the United States.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your information may be stored and processed on servers in Tennessee and in other states within the U.S. We do not transfer your personal information outside the United States.</p>

    <p>By using Hustl, you consent to your information being processed in the United States under U.S. and Tennessee law.</p>

    <p><strong>Security Note:</strong> For security reasons, we do not publicly disclose the specific names or locations of all our service providers, but we ensure all providers meet industry standards for data security and comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We keep personal information only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described above and as required by law. In general:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and profile data:</strong> Kept while your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward (for example, up to 7 years) to comply with tax, accounting, and legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Job and transaction data:</strong> Kept for at least the applicable limitation period for legal claims and tax rules, usually several years.</li>
      <li><strong>Messages and reviews:</strong> Retained as part of job records and platform history, unless removal is required by law or we decide to delete them sooner.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may also anonymize or aggregate data so it can no longer identify you and use that information for analytics and business purposes indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>

    <p>We use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect personal information, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit (when being sent) and at rest (when stored) using industry-standard encryption methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We limit access to personal information to authorized personnel only, and use authentication and authorization systems to protect data.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Our database, file storage, and hosting providers use secure, monitored infrastructure with regular security updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> We regularly monitor for unusual login activity, payment anomalies, and potential security threats.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> Payment information is handled by PCI-DSS compliant processors (Stripe) and is never stored on Hustl's servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You use Hustl at your own risk and should keep your account credentials private and secure. We recommend using strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor authentication if we offer it in the future.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Breach Notice for Tennessee Residents</h2>

    <p>Tennessee law requires businesses that suffer a security breach involving certain types of personal information to notify affected residents, generally within 45 days of discovering the breach, subject to any law-enforcement delays.</p>

    <p>If we ever experience a breach that involves your personal information and triggers Tennessee's data breach laws, we will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Investigate and take steps to secure our systems;</li>
      <li>Notify you and, if required, regulators or consumer reporting agencies;</li>
      <li>Provide information about what happened and steps you can take to protect yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Privacy Rights (Including TIPA-Style Rights)</h2>

    <p>As Hustl grows, it may become subject to the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), which, once applicable, gives Tennessee consumers certain rights such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The right to confirm whether a business is processing your personal information;</li>
      <li>The right to access your personal information;</li>
      <li>The right to correct inaccuracies;</li>
      <li>The right to delete certain personal information;</li>
      <li>The right to data portability (a copy of your data in a usable format);</li>
      <li>The right to opt out of:
        <ul>
          <li>Sale of your personal information;</li>
          <li>Targeted advertising;</li>
          <li>Certain types of profiling.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even if Hustl is not yet legally required to comply with TIPA due to its small size, we intend to voluntarily honor the following basic rights for Tennessee users, subject to reasonable verification and limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong> – You can request a summary of the personal information we have about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction</strong> – You can request that we correct inaccurate account or profile information.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion</strong> – You can request deletion of your account and certain associated data, except information we need to keep for legal, tax, or security reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out of Sale & Targeted Ads</strong> – We currently do not sell your personal information or use it for targeted advertising. If that ever changes, we will provide an easy way to opt out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can exercise these rights by emailing <a href="mailto:team.hustlapp@outlook.com">team.hustlapp@outlook.com</a> with "Privacy Request" in the subject line. We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Hustl is not intended for anyone under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 18.</p>

    <p>If we learn that a user under 18 has created an account or provided personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information and close the account.</p>

    <h2>11. Communications and Marketing</h2>

    <p>We may send you transactional emails (account changes, job updates, receipts, policy updates) that are necessary to operate Hustl. You cannot opt out of these without closing your account.</p>

    <p>We may send optional product or feature updates by email. You can opt out of those by following the unsubscribe instructions or contacting us.</p>

    <p>We do not sell your contact information to third-party marketers.</p>

    <h2>12. Do Not Track and Other Signals</h2>

    <p>Your browser may send "Do Not Track" (DNT) or similar signals. There is currently no standard for how online services should respond to these signals, and Hustl does not respond to DNT signals at this time. We will update this Policy if that changes.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal requirements. When we do:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We will update the "Last updated" date at the top;</li>
      <li>For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g., in-app notice or email).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you continue to use Hustl after the updated Policy becomes effective, you are agreeing to the updated Policy. If you do not agree, you must stop using Hustl and request account deletion.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact Us</h2>
