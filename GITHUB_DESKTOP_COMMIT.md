# 📝 Where to Type "Ready for Railway deployment" in GitHub Desktop

## After You Published the Repository:

### Step 1: Look at the Bottom of GitHub Desktop

1. In GitHub Desktop, you should see your repository open
2. Look at the **BOTTOM LEFT** of the window
3. You'll see a text box that says something like:
   - "Summary" or "Commit message"
   - Or it might be blank

### Step 2: Type Your Commit Message

1. Click in that text box at the bottom
2. Type: `Ready for Railway deployment`
3. (Or any message you want, like "Initial commit" or "Deploy to Railway")

### Step 3: Look for Files to Commit

1. In the **LEFT SIDE** of GitHub Desktop, you'll see:
   - A list of files that have changes
   - They might show as "Modified" or "New"
   - Files like: `server.js`, `package.json`, `index.html`, etc.

2. Make sure files are **checked/selected** (they should be by default)

### Step 4: Click "Commit to main"

1. After typing your message, look for a button at the bottom
2. It will say: **"Commit to main"** (or "Commit to master")
3. Click that button

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

1. After committing, look at the **TOP RIGHT** of GitHub Desktop
2. You'll see a button that says: **"Push origin"** or **"Push"**
3. Click that button
4. Wait for it to finish (you'll see a progress indicator)
